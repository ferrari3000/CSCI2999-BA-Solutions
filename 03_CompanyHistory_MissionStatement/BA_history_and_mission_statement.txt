						B.A. Solutions History

Founder Ed Petry started Business Analytics Solutions in September of 1995, as a response to the dot-com boom. Businesses all over the world were starting to see the economic opportunity the internet could provide, and Ed saw the same opportunity for local businesses in Columbus, OH. The first office was located off of High Street, near the Ohio State University Campus. There, he and small team of dedicated developers, network engineers, and IT professionals began to consult for businesses in the area. 
In 1999, Ed and his team landed their first major contract with Columbus City Schools (then Columbus Public Schools). B.A. Solutions were asked to create the school systemâ€™s first internet site, and a failover network system for their ever-growing student data system. After successful completion of the project, B.A. Solutions gained much notoriety in the Columbus IT community. To date, B.A. Solutions has worked with such notable companies as Nationwide Insurance, Huntington Bank, and Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. 
Today, B.A Solutions resides in Two Miranova Place, alongside the Scioto River. The company has grown from the small team Ed started into a 25 employee operation! B.A. Solutions has been, and always will be, heavily tied to the Columbus business community. We are dedicated to helping local businesses, large and small, and we are the best at what we do.
